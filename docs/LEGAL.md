# Legal mumbo-jumbo

In reference to the European Union's GDPR regulations and other legal rules and regulations that I may not be aware of at this time:

- This is a hobby project. It has no commercial background whatsoever.

- Although official government warning message feeds are consumed by this program, ``mowas-pwb`` itself is not an official Government warning app. __If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.__ Even though its purpose is to alert you during hazardous situations, don't rely on ``mowas-pwb``'s availability and content validity during a life-and-death situation as sole source of information. When in doubt, always consult additional sources of information such as TV, radio & cell broadcasts and the Internet.

- Both DAPNET messaging option or the ``follow-the-ham`` aprs.fi tracking option __require you to be a licensed ham radio operator__. If you run this program in Telegram-or-Email-only mode, no ham radio license is required, though.

- In case the ``follow-the-ham`` option is used: The user's position information (as well as other APRS user's position data) which is used by this program is acquired from freely accessible data sources such as aprs.fi et al. These data sources gather APRS information from ham radio users who did decide to have their position information actively submitted to the APRS network. Any of these information sources can already be used for a various user's position inquiry.

- If you intend to host your own instance of ``mowas-pwb``, you need to provide API access keys to the following services:
    - sender's email and password and/or
    - telegram.org and/or
    - DAPNET / hampager.de. __Requires a valid ham radio license.__
    - optional: aprs.fi access key. __Requires a valid ham radio license.__

If you use this program, then you agree to these terms and conditions. Thank you.
